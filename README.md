# Stripe-API-Payment
A simple payment page has been implemented in OOP PHP, SCSS and js. The payment page accepts credit cards through Stripe API, and also stores data in a MySQL db through PDO. Besides that, there has been implemented two pages that shows a list of all customers and transaction, as you would normally see through Stripe dashboard.  

In addition, a login, registration and forgotten pwd system has also been implemented in OOP PHP, SCSS and HTML. The reason behind this choice is authentication reason, so that not everyone has the ability to see the list of all customers and transaction, unless they are registered in the system.
